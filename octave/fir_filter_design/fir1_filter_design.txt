% Prerequisites:
% sudo apt-get install octave octave-signal

%%%% STEP0:
% load signal package in octave:
pkg load signal

%%%% STEP1:
% At first specify the sampling frequency:
fs = 400;

%%%% STEP2:
% Then set the cutoff frequency:
fc = 50;

%%%% STEP3:
% then use the function fir1 to design a fir1 filter: (here order 50)
coeffs = fir1(50, fc/(fs/2));

%%%% OPTIONAL STEP:
	% if you want you can plot the filters magnitude and phase response with (1024 points), here normalized frequency:
	freqz(coeffs,1,1024,fs);

	% you can also plot impulse response:
	x = [1,zeros(1,256-1)];
	y = filter(coeffs,1,x);
	plot(y);

	% or you can draw step response with 256 samples:
	x = [1,ones(1,256-1)];
	y = filter(coeffs,1,x);
	plot(y);

%%%% STEP4:
% you can now print a C conform output of the coeffs with the function convert_fir1_to_c_code which should be included
% in the matlab-script convert_fir1_to_c_code.m (using floating point precision "5.16f")
% include the output into your c program
[~,rows] = size(coeffs);
convert_fir1_to_c_code
